Hola! soy Alberto Vallecillo, un Ingeniero Electrónico con experiencia en Telecomunicaciones, he trabajado en empresas como Telecom Argentina y Siemens, en organismos de gobierno como el Gobierno de San Juan.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Alberto Vallecillo, @Alb3rtoGitHub, an Electronic Engineer with Telecommunications Networks experience, I've worked at Siemens and Telecom Argentina enterprises, and San Juan's government as Deputy Director of Data Networks and Data Center.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development as a Junior at the beginning (as Trainee at least!), because I'm studying Full Stack Programmer and I discovered that I'm passionate about programming and it is very easy for me.
- 🌱 I’ve finished recently my studies as Java Full Stack Application Programmer and I'm studying Python Fundamentals. I can work with Git/GitHub and Springboot/Hibernate to develop APIs Rest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Projects to learn more and collaborate in AI projects, Data Science or programs applied to Industry, Automatic Control, Telecommunications, IoT, etc.

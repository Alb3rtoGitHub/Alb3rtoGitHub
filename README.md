👋 Hi, I’m Alberto Vallecillo (@Alb3rtoGitHub), an Electronic Engineer with experience in Telecommunications Networks. I’ve worked at Siemens and Telecom Argentina, and for the Government of San Juan as Deputy Director of Data Networks and Data Center.

👀 I’m interested in starting my career in software development as a Junior Developer (or at least as a Trainee). I’m currently studying Full Stack Programming, and I discovered that I’m truly passionate about coding — it comes naturally to me.

🌱 I recently completed my studies as a Java Full Stack Application Developer, and I’m now studying Python Fundamentals. I can work with Git/GitHub and Spring Boot/Hibernate to develop REST APIs.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software projects to keep learning and contribute to areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or applications for Industry, Automation, Telecommunications, and IoT.
